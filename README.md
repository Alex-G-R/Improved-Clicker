# Improved-Clicker
This is a simple web-game based on JavaScript. It's a classic clicker with working and implemented game loop witch is achived through resets that increase your multiplayer of clicks you gain


To run this app you need to have some sort of a server.
You can't run it directily from files. 
I personaly would reccomend Live Server (VS code extention)
But there are other options (copied from Stack Overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52919331/access-to-script-at-from-origin-null-has-been-blocked-by-cors-policy/66951910#66951910?newreg=e180875d1b424d43825b58368bd4b459)

"Looks like you're trying to open the web-page locally (via file:// protocol) i.e. double clicking the .html file.
Unfortunately modules only work via HTTP(s), so all you need to do is use a local web server. Popular choices include:

 - Live Server, a VS Code extension that adds a right-click option to run your pages with a local server.
  
 - Node static server, a simple http server to serve static resource files from a local directory.
   
 - Node live server is easy to install and use:
 ( npm install -g live-server // Install globally via npm )
 ( live-server                // Run in the html's directory)
   
 - Or even shorter and without altering your packages:
 (npx live-server)"
